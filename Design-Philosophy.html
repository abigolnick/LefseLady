											<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

												<p>Inclusive designing reflects the values of people who want their websites to be accessible to everyone.</p> 
												
												<h3>Blog Posts</h3>
												<p>My blog, Lefse Lady, is designed so that all the information contained in the site is accessible in many different areas. There is a page where all of the blog posts are linked, a drop down menu with each of the blog posts, on the home page toward the bottom left you can find a third way to get to the blog posts. On the left side of each blog post there is a link to go to the next blog post in order. As well as the Quick Links toward the bottom left hand side of the page.</p> 
												
												<p>You can access the Cornerstone Project, Accessibility and Design Philosophy, as well as the About page in multiple ways. The first choice on the homepage is two large, purple buttons in the center of the screen that will take you to the Cornerstone Project and Accessibility and Design Philosophy. If you scroll down the webpage just a little further you will find a brief of the About page as well as a large, purple button that will take you to the About page. Other ways to get to these pages are along the top banner, where they are stated as links or on the Blog Posts Page where they are the final three options. Each page will also bring you to the next post on the list. And finally, again, the Quick Links toward the bottom left hand side of the page.</p> 
												
												<p>All of these multiple pathways make for “easy interaction” and “helpful wayfinding” (Horton and Queensbury, 2013, p. 5). </p>
												
												<h3>Images</h3>
												Each image uploaded will have alternative text in order to describe the images for the ease of use for screen readers. </p>
												
												<h3>Web Accessibility Initiative</h3>
												<p>Designing for Web Accessibility on the Web Accessibility Initiative page provides the user with multiple considerations that help web designers to create an inclusive webpage with accessibility in mind. One of the main points that the page makes is that color is paramount. </p>
												
												<h3>Colors</h3>
												<p>The first thing that the page states is to have a good contrast between the background and foreground. It goes on to say to not “use color alone to convey information” (). Providing “clear and consistent navigation options” is also very important. This ensures that the user on the webpage is able to find important information in the same place on each page. </p>
												
												<h3>Headings and Subheadings</h3>
												<p>Using headings and subheadings helps with readability. Also making sure not to indent new paragraphs. The only change to these headings and subheadings should be font, font size, and whether or not they are altered by bolding or italicizing.</p> 
												
												<h3>Viewport Sizes</h3>
												<p>Making sure that the webpage is viewable in almost every way imaginable is also important. The website template I used for Lefse Lady automatically rearranges the pages in order to make them accessible on different devices. The page also resizes itself on the laptop screen when the user makes the page smaller in order to view something else. </p>
