												<h3>Starbuck, Minnesota</h3>

														<h3>Fargo, North Dakota</h3>
												<p>On August 13 and 14th in Fargo, North Dakota, the Fargo-Moorhead AM Rotary Club hosts the Lobster and Lefse Festival at Fargo’s Newman Outdoor field (the baseball diamond that is home to the Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks).  Admission is $3 for adults (people 13 and older). 
												
													<p>Dinner costs $20 and consists of steamed Maine lobster, lefse, and corn on the cob. 
												
														<p>The proceeds from this event go to the Fargo Rape and Abuse Crisis Center, YWCA Cass Clay and Rotary projects. 
												
															<h3>Fosston, Minnesota</h3>
												<p>November 16th in Fosston, Minnesota Civic Center, the best lefse makes in the area will gather. At this gathering, people compete for the title of “Champion Lefse Maker.” The results of this competition are samples given to visitors and also sales of lefse in order to stock up for the holiday season.

The Potato Days Festival invites participants to partake in the National Lefse Cookoff. 
												
													<p>These festivals go to show that Norwegian culture is still thriving in the Northern States of the United States.
